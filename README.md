This repository contains code for a Speaker Identification System implemented in Python.

The system utilizes Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for speaker modeling.

The folders Testing_Audio and Voice_Samples_Training have relevant testing and training data for the model and the recognition.ipynb notebook contains the entire code
